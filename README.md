# Zero-shot Object Counting with Good Exemplars
## News
VA-Count is accepted by ECCV2024. 
Our code will be available soonÔºÅ
## Overview 
Overview of the proposed method. The proposed method focuses on two main elements: the Exemplar Enhancement Module (EEM) for improving exemplar quality through a patch selection integrated with Grounding DINO, and the Noise Suppression Module (NSM) that distinguishes between positive and negative class samples using density maps. It employs a Contrastive Loss function to refine the precision in identifying target class objects from others in an image.
