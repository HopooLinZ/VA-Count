# [ECCV 2024]Zero-shot Object Counting with Good Exemplars
## News
[[Project page]([https://github.com/HopooLinZ/VA-Count/] 
An officical implementation of "Zero-shot Object Counting with Good Exemplars" (Accepted by ECCV 2024).   
## Overview
Overview of the proposed method. The proposed method focuses on two main elements: the Exemplar Enhancement Module (EEM) for improving exemplar quality through a patch selection integrated with Grounding DINO, and the Noise Suppression Module (NSM) that distinguishes between positive and negative class samples using density maps. It employs a Contrastive Loss function to refine the precision in identifying target class objects from others in an image.
